Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Error in rule samtools_sort:
    jobid: 5
    output: sorted_reads/B.bam
    shell:
        samtool sort -T sorted_reads/B -O bam mapped_reads/B.bam > sorted_reads/B.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job samtools_sort since they might be corrupted:
sorted_reads/B.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
