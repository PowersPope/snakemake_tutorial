# Snakemake Test Repo

I created this repo by following the tutorial found on https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html

Will be using snakemake for future projects going forward. 


Snakemake is an tool that is used among bioinformaticians/computational biologists, that make a data pipeline reproducible by standardizing the process line. Also, by making sure only certain versions of tools are used in the data pipeline.
